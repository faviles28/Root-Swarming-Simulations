# Stick To Your Roots: Swarm Behavior in Plant Root Growth

Repository for Princeton COS IW11 project simulations

To run simulations, first download NetLogo simulation software [here](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml).

Once NetLogo is downloaded, go to File -> Open -> .nlogo file you wish to run.

**original_research.nlogo** contains the simulation for the non-random model of growth proposed by Ciszak et al.

**roots_all.nlogo** contains the simulation for the all encompassing model of growth.

**roots_moisture_branching.nlogo** contains the simulation for the heterogeneous water with branching model of growth

**roots_moisture_nonbranching.nlogo** contains the simulation for the heterogeneous water without branching model of growth
